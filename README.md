I'm a Magna Cum Laude graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science from Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan, and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I have a strong foundation in multiple programming languages and frameworks, which I've demonstrated through university projects and my personal GitHub portfolio. I am eager to apply my academic excellence and hands-on skills to build innovative web solutions.
